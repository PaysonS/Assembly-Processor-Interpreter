# Assembly-Processor-Interpreter
An interpreter that takes a file of assembly language and interprets it into C++.
Uses a file of assembly language to add, multiply, loop, provide a fibonacci sequence, and give the sum if squares up to n.
It interprets it by creating a new output file with the assembly formatted nicely and reads that new file to store the memory and commands to execute later on.

How to use:
Compile and run with ./a.out (txt file).

To operate the add.txt file you enter the numbers you would like to add and when you are finished inputting you enter 0 as your next number.

To operate multiply.txt enter two numbers and it will output.

For the rest of the txt files just input one number
